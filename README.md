- Java 21+, Maven 3.6+
- Node.js 18+, npm
- **Docker** (required for backend database services)

### Backend Setup

It is important to have Docker already running on the machine.

```bash
cd parking-managment-api
./run.sh dev  # API available at localhost:8081
```

### Frontend Setup

**Open a new terminal/console and run:**

```bash
cd parking-managment-web
./run.sh dev  # App available at localhost:8082
```

## 🔐 Test Credentials

**Manager Account:**
```

- Various vehicle types (auto, moto, camioneta, etc)
- Active reservations and walk-in stays
- Price configurations per vehicle type

## 🔧 Development

### Backend Commands
```bash
./run.sh dev         # Run with H2 database (default)
./run.sh local       # Run with PostgreSQL
./run.sh prod        # Run with production settings
```

### Frontend Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # Code linting
npm run type-check   # TypeScript checking
```
